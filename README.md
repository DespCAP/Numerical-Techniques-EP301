# Numerical-Techniques-EP301
This repository contains the toolkit and the numerical techniques developed as part of the course EP301 at IIT Patna.  

Topics Covered
- Linear Algebra and Matrix Methods
- Root Finding Algorithms 
- Numerical Integration and Differentiation
- Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
- Interpolation and Curve Fitting

# Getting Started 
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DespCAP/Numerical-Techniques-EP301.git
```
Navigate to the desired folder and follow the instructions provided in the README files.

# Add repository to your system path
```python
import sys
import os

# Define the path to your repository
repo_path = '/path/to/your/repository/numerical-techniques-ep301'

# Add the repository path to the system path
if repo_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(repo_path)

# Verify that the path has been added
print(sys.path)
```

# Check function descriptions in the files
```python
# file_names = [calculus,diffeqns,fitting,matrix,roots]
import <file_name>

help(<file_name>)
```
Alternatively, you can also check out the Wiki for the function descriptions.
